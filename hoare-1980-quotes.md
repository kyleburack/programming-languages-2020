Some favourite quotes from [Hoare's 1980 Turing Award Lecture](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1283920.1283936).  The only one that looks controversial to me after all this time is the one about exception handling. Would be interesting to understand more about the background.

  - "I believe our customers were fortunate that hardware limitations had protected them from the arbitrary excesses of our software designs. In the present day, users of microprocessors benefit from a similar protection--but not for much longer."
  - "Earlier attention paid to quite minor requests of our customers might have paid as great dividends of goodwill as the success of our most ambitious plans." 
  - "A lack of clarity in specification is one of the surest signs of a deficiency in the program."
  - "You know, you shouldn't trust us intelligent programmers. We can think up such good arguments for convincing ourselves and each other of the utterly absurd. Especially don't believe us when we promise to repeat an earlier success, only bigger and better next time."
  - "In no case would we consider a request for a feature that would take more than three months to implement and deliver."
  - "there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult."
  - "When any new language design project is nearing completion, there is always a mad rush to get new features added before standardization. The rush is mad indeed, because it leads into a trap from which there is no escape. A feature which is omitted can always be added later, when its design and its implications are well understood. A feature which is included before it is fully understood can never be removed later."
  - "At first I hoped that such a technically unsound project would collapse but I soon realized it was doomed to success. Almost anything in software can be implemented, sold, and even used given enough determination. There is nothing a mere scientist can say that will stand against the flood of a hundred million dollars. But there is one quality that cannot be purchased in this way--and that is reliability. The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay."
  - "features and notational conventions, many of them unnecessary and some of them, like exception handling, even dangerous."
  - "If only we could learn the right lessons from the successes of the past, we would not need to learn from our failures."
